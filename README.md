# V.O.I.C.E---Voice-Oriented-Intelligent-Command-Engine

An offline, AI-powered IoT automation system using **ESP32**, **OLED display**, and a **locally hosted chatbot** built with **Node.js** and **Ollama**.

## Project Overview

**V.O.I.C.E (Voice Oriented Intelligent Command Engine)** demonstrates the integration of **AI + IoT** for smart home automation.  
It allows users to control connected devices via **voice commands**, and when unknown commands are given, the ESP32 queries a **locally hosted chatbot** for intelligent responses — all displayed on the OLED.

## Features

- 🎤 **Voice-Controlled IoT Devices** (Light, Fan, Relay)
- 💬 **Offline AI Chatbot Integration** via Ollama
- 🖥️ **Dynamic OLED Display** for real-time feedback
- 🌐 **WebSocket-based Control Interface**
- 📶 **WiFiManager** for easy Wi-Fi & chatbot setup (no re-upload needed)
- 💡 **Fully Local and Privacy-Preserving** – runs without cloud
